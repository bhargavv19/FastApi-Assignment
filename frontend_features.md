    -   Input for chat name (if applicable based on backend).
-   **View/List Chats:**
    -   Display a list of all chats associated with the logged-in user.
    -   Each item in the list should be selectable to view its details.
-   **View Chat Details & Messages:**
    -   Upon selecting a chat, display its messages in chronological order.
    -   Show chat metadata (e.g., name of the chat).
-   **Update Chat Metadata:**

## 4. Branching Functionality

    -   On any message within a chat, provide an option to create a new branch starting from that message.
-   **View Branches:**
    -   Display a visual representation (e.g., a list or a simple tree structure) of all branches associated with the current main conversation.
    -   Clearly indicate parent-child relationships between branches.
-   **Switch Active Branch:**
